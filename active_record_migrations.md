# Active Record Migrations

##What are Migrations?

Migrations are an easy way of altering an existing database schema over a period of time in a consistent and easy way. In other words, it is moving from the current version of a database to a newer version. It uses Ruby DSL (Domain Specific Language), which allows the schema and database to be database independent and relieve us, the developer, from writing our own SQL.
